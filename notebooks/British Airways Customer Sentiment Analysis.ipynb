However checkin agent was unfamiliar with BA size and weight rules for sports bags so had to wait 10 minutes while phone calls were made -- annoying. Lounge was good. Gate service was excellent with organised queues. Seat was good (the new upgraded Club Suite). The zip broke off the amenity kit so it was unusable -- BA cutting corners too much here. Offered a cocktail service which came promptly and the drink was excellent. But no nuts! So I went off to the galley to ask for some nuts or a snack to go with it. I spoke to a male flight attendant who looked at me with utter distaste that I had the temerity to ask for nuts. The he said \"where have you come from?\". What a bizarre question. I said \"seat 8E\" to which he responded with a flick of his hand - \"go ask her, she's serving you.\" I was stunned - I have not been treated that way in even the cheapest restaurants, let alone business class on a premium airline. The gentlemen concerned has no place in service or hospitality and should find a different line of work. Anyway, the food was good. The IFE worked fine. WiFi wasn't working. I managed 6.5 hours sleep and we got off the plane promptly despite being at a remote stand, requiring a bus. The luggage took quite a while to arrive. Overall 7/10. Would be 9/10 but for the rude staff member.",

The flight is just over 3 hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits. No water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. She claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering. There was no route map on this A320. The captain made only 2 very brief announcements. When I needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues – they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory. I shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor. One concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration. Disembarkation was not well managed either.

We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied. Every time I contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them.",

The not so good news I’m afraid to say was the flight itself. The food has really gone downhill since my last flight, presumably this is a cost cutting measure. If other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why can’t an airline of BA’s stature? I’ve always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time. The crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions. They couldn’t even be bothered to say cheerio, and I’m not sure I would have answered if they did. Here’s hoping my return is a more satisfying experience.",

My only issue with that flight was the pillows they gave us were dirty and when my 7 year old dropped some juice and I asked a cabin crew member walking past for some serviettes she told me to go to the bathroom to get some to clean it up. Those issues weren’t pleasant but certainly not a major problem. I was booked on the BA0057 at 21:15 on 31 December 2024 to return to Johannesburg. The flight was delayed to the 1 January 2025 at 12:00pm. I had a connecting flight to Durban and do not live in Johannesburg. Landing in Johannesburg with 3 children at 1 am was not an option for me. BA changed my flight to 2nd January 2025 at 18:25. I requested a sooner date so I could get home sooner. I was given 1 January 2025 at 21:15. I accepted this as this is the original time I opted for and would he most convenient for me as I was doing a connection in Johannesburg to Durban. Unfortunately this flight was delayed till 2nd January at 17:00. I was extremely upset by this as I was absolutely exhausted and had 3 children who were absolutely exhausted. I also suffer from eczema and hay fever and did not have my creams and medication. This caused my eczema to flare up so badly, even my lips were cracked and burning. My allergies were so severe that my eyes were sticking together and I couldn’t stop sneezing. My daughter also has eczema and has had a flare up. The staff had no sympathy or empathy for a mother traveling alone and her children. I was just told that they know it’s an inconvenience and a lady even snapped at me that they trying their best. My children are 4, 7 and 11 and we were all booked on separate seats. Is that even legal let alone ethical? They were refusing to help me and saying they can’t do anything. I approached 3 people, and the third person finally put us together. So they could clearly help me??? My flight from Johannesburg to Durban was originally booked on South African Airways and I paid a lot for this ticket as South African Airways is not a low cost airline. I was given a cheap low cost Airline, CemAir, which I had never even heard of, to replace my SAA flight. I suffer from flight anxiety and this is why I never book low cost airlines with tiny flights. My anxiety went through the roof on the flight! Besides all of this, I am also left with a huge credit card bill as I used up all my pounds on the 1st! I know BA is obliged to compensate me for the inconvenience under EU law but besides the compensation BA staff really needs to show more empathy for their passengers, like me, who had two hours long flight delays two days in a row and was alone with 3 children. I expect my full compensation for all of us as this has been by far the worst experience I have had traveling. All their staff kept saying is “that’s why you will get compensation.” I am now waiting to see if I get compensated as I was promised by all of their ground staff! Legally they have to under EU law, so let’s see if they put up a fight or do what is ethical and legal.",

BA have moved the Business Class checkin from one end of the hall to the other at T5 for no apparent reason so a nice long walk to check in. Fast Track security was very slow (15 minutes). The indicator board suggested the South Lounge was \"half full\" but when I went it was uncomfortably full and it is still tatty as not refurbished, so I went to the B Pier lounge instead. Much better except as usual the staff are sort of trying to pack up early and have a bizarre way of refilling the food containers which involves actually removing them to the kitchen (which means they are gone a lot of the time) rather than replenishing them customer side. Very employee-centric behaviour. Time for the flight so down to the transit to take us to the C Gates. Except the transit had decided not to stop any more at the B Gates so we watched five maybe seven transits pass through without stopping. Eventually me and a group of maybe 15 other passengers of mixed ages decided to descend to the walkway and run all the way to the C Gates. We all arrived soaked in sweat - not a nice start to a long business class flight. The A380 is spacious but the seat is outdated now and in urgent need of replacement. IFE was not working and had to be rebooted. The headphone prong was bent so headphones not working. The USB port was not working. Drinks were brought out promptly. Starter (salmon) was delicious - truly excellent. Beef was tough ... I think a bad piece of meat rather than badly cooked. Wines were good. Cheese was average to good. Staff were friendly. Good night's sleep. Breakfast good. The recheck experience at JNB is a huge hassle - there is a giant screen saying \"Domestic recheck\" and a queue but when you get to the front of the queue you are told it is SAFAIR only and not for SAA, BA's local partner. What a hassle. Why aren't we warned or told this ... loads of BA passengers making the same mistake. Overall 5/10. It's the little things that would make this better: fast track actually fast track. Refurbish the South Lounge. Have food replenishment in the passenger area, not the kitchen; make sure the transits stop, even late in the evening; refurbish the A380s; ask Do & Co (who are generally excellent by the way) to monitor meat quality rigorously.",

What did BA offer during this 8 hour hell flight, 3 oatmeal biscuits and 250ml of water for our family.

After we arrived late my connecting flight had now been missed. We then queued at the connections desk in a large queue only to watch the BA staff clock off for the night in front of us. No genuine support was given to me, or my family and we were effectively abandoned by BA. I’ve tried to speak to someone, but their helpline has an automated message saying due to the number of calls (not surprised by that aspect) they cant assist me, then hang up.

         "✅Trip Verified|   This was the first time I flew British Airways, and it was a huge disappointment. While the seat is quite good, the food is very simple and the service is subpar. But not only that, Heathrow airport, their hub, is by far the worst large airport I’ve seen in Europe. When we landed in DC I had an email saying that my luggage stayed in London. This was last Wednesday. I have an AirTag so I could follow my suitcase. It came to Washington the following day, Thursday. Ever since, it’s been sitting in the airport. British offers no means of communication: the online chat is a bot. The bot tells me to call a number in England. I did. It’s another bot. When you say you have in inquiry about luggage it sends you a link via SMS and hangs up. No option to talk to a human. In the claim form they gave me there’s a local phone, which reaches a voicemail. I keep calling them (6 times today only) and leaving messages, saying that the AirTag shows the suitcase in IAD and offering to go pick it up so they don’t need to deliver it. No one replies to the voicemail. So basically I am shut out, with no luggage, no information, no customer service and no one to talk to.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   Pretty good flight but still some small things that can be improved. Check in was quick. Lounge was good - tasty food and well chosen wines. Disappointingly they had not secured a gate so we had to bus to the aircraft and it was all a hot scrum. I got the last bus to avoid the crush. Emirates, Turkish, Lufthansa, Qatar all had planes on gates ... why not BA? Penny-pinching? Then it turned out the cabin crew forgot about those on the last bus so I had to ask for a welcome drink. It came and the champagne was actually cold. Well done BA ... first time they managed to serve champagne cold in my 10 years of flying with them. Big improvement. Cabin and seat were lovely as always (I greatly prefer to the Emirates white/gold bling). Drinks service was prompt. IFE was good. Starter (trout) was OK. Main (chicken) was excellent. Cheese was sold not cold (as it should be). Wines were excellent. We were not disturbed through the night so got a good sleep on a comfy bed. Cabin was a bit too warm though for my personal preference. Was woken up (as asked) and served a tasty breakfast. Small detail - as it is impossible to get water to 100C at altitude maybe BA could warm the ceramic coffee cups so coffee retains its heat a bit longer? Pouring not quite hot coffee into a nice (but cold) china mug means it is lukewarm instantly. Off the plane in record time (2 minutes) after parking. Bags were waiting for us on the belt. Excellent work by the ground staff. Overall 8/10. Improvement points: gate not bus to the plane; don't forget passengers on the last bus or who board late (but well before pushback). Standout cabin crew member was \"Miguel\" - what a star.",

It's the insane saga of events that proceeded to claim the compensation that I'm legally entitled to according to EU rules. Used their claims page and all was OK. It was from there that it became incomprehensibly frustrating. My case was closed but no confirmation of what the conclusion was or any money. I tried calling but kept being lead in circles; customer services can't speak to the claims team, the claims team can't be spoken to directly, customer service don't have access to the claims team's system and so on. 4 calls later and 'nothing could be done'. I had to throw my toys out of the pram on the last call and someone finally updated me. I thought that was the end; they had confirmed the claim and that I would be transferred what I was due. And then, they got the amount wrong. I wrote to they to highlight this and they said that they would rectify it. Almost 1 month since the original flight was cancelled and still haven't received what is owed to me as compensation for my wife and son. I have sent two more emails in the last two days and I've yet to get a response. It is criminal that they are not adhering to the aviation rules that dictate compensation for cancelled flights.

Soon after I started to get emails saying my selected seats (I paid extra for the selection) had been changed by BA without any reason given and I was directed to the website. There I found no information on the said seat change. This happened several times (I had 4 flights altogether). The website seems to be a digital dinosaur. The first leg of my flight was fine, until I discovered in the transfer area at Heathrow that I forgot my new laptop onboard. Immediately I contacted BA's so called Customer Service (what an oxymoron), which basically said they can not do anything, I would have to wait until the cleaners (working for a contractor) would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called Lost & Found at the airport. BA's customer service said they couldn't contact their colleagues in the terminal/gate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no 27A of the plane (yes I told them exactly were the laptop was). They wouldn't take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident. They simply had no interest in assisting me and didn't even make an attempt to pretend they did. Communication via their online customer service was poor, and they didn't even respond to my messages. In the end I emailed the representative at Heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor (which did not reveal his name): \"It is not the duty of British Airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers, however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback.\" They took no responsibility and referred me to Smartecarte, which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items at Heathrow. I have not received the laptop, worth 2 thousand GBP, back now 3 weeks later. The flights between London and Cape Town (~12 hours), were unpleasant. The flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job, it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal, which also was distributed extremely slowly. Food was not good. Boarding was slow and inefficient. Drinks were only offered twice (otherwise you'd have to ask for it especially) on this long flights.

She was torturous, BA was horrendous because the website does not allow you to do all this. A very poor experience, in all.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   Singapore to Heathrow with BA. Two choices on this route A380 or 777-300. In economy and premium (and first) there isn’t much in it. In club world the 777 wins as it has the suite. Check in was easy. Security and passport control in Singapore is efficient. Choice of 3 lounges (BA, Qantas or Qatar) the latter wins easily. BA lounge was ok no major negatives. Qantas wins on space. Boarding was on time. The aircraft has a high density club world cabin. Service was fine. Club suite was good. It’s the food and beverages that are being targeted I feel. The 1st meal starter was good, main of beef fillet was average, same sentiment for cheese. Wines were acceptable. Champagne choice is cheap so I did not try. Service for meals efficient given the full cabin. Breakfast was similar. The menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert, for this to work for BA, a major shift in how lounge options are sourced and presented would be needed. As it was I slept well, we arrived early, luggage off quickly (for once) so a reasonable flight overall. My warning to BA is that food and beverages in club world are drifting in the wrong direction",

         "✅Trip Verified|   I recently travelled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes. Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance. After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldn’t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes. When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next time—ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place! This experience cost us a staggering £682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing. British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. I will never fly with them again, and I urge others to consider alternative airlines.",

Upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said I was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old I presume (65) since there is no other reason I can find I could not sit in the exit seating. I am healthy enough to walk 10-12 miles a day and have adequate upper body strength. Attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat, at the rear of the aircraft, second floor and in the middle two seats of the row. We were told our money would be refunded immediately for the \"inconvenience\". After several weeks I recontacted BA and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section. 6 weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in 3 weeks, keep waiting. The plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair. They completed that 30 minutes later and boarded the flight. The captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another 30 minutes. We were not able to make up for the lost time in the air. We landed 1.5 hours later than scheduled, wreaking havoc with our next flight.",

         "✅Trip Verified|  I decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to World Traveller Plus on the return leg of our Canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. I hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because I had assumed I would be enjoying the entertainment BA had promised. So I decided to lie back and get some rest instead, only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. The flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when I had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (I have a bad lower back). Early on in this experience I asked to be moved to economy so that I could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. The apologetic flight attendant assured me I would receive compensation, which I assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew BA, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of World Traveller Plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance). BA's actual compensation offer: £25 worth of Avios points each. I wrote back (since BA doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds I'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. They then ghosted me. My experience is a cautionary tale about British Airways customer support. If all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant World Traveller Plus experience. But if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. So unless you're prepared to gamble, I would advise you to either stick with Economy/World Traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from A to B, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. Or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. If your flight is to Canada, I would recommend an airline such as Air Canada, which I turned to during the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. They do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-Covid, I started flying BA again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important. I now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy - one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   On arriving at Mexico Airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from LHR was about six hours late. When we eventually managed to check in we told that – contrary to the BA website – we could not have access to the 24-hour Grand Lounge Elite and instead would use the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left. After that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher. Two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to Cancun because of a “volcanic ash cloud over Mexico City” – although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from Europe. They eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at 1.30am. We were assured that we would all be on a BA flight leaving the same time the following day. The only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel. He said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details. (When we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared.) During the night, we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an Air Canada flight leaving at 6.30am. This would have been impossible with such short notice and without Canadian EPA authorisation. We then spent two hours trying to make contact with BA – its Mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an Aeromexico flight in economy. They told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra £200 for the seats. Later, after a very long call, we were told that we could be upgraded to business with Aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability. BA then informed us that because we had already checked in – as they had suggested – we could not be moved and this took three more calls to Aeromexico to sort out. I totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers. We were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the UK but others – such as a disabled lady – had been told nothing when we left.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   I have flown British Airways for many years and still do so regularly. In one of my last flights this past summer between Paris and Boston, British booked me on a connecting flight between Paris and London that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in London. London Heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals. So already, one is pressed for time. My flight from Paris to London that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact. BA Flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. – don’t bother with this one. Flight Connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that I was rushing to the gate. It was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart. I ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane. The agent said that since no one knew where I was (false) the plane left without me – early. Gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay. So I made the 20 minute trek back to Flight Connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. I was now going to miss the wedding I was destined to attend in Boston. They sent me to a prepaid Hilton hotel room for the night but told me that I would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there. They gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement. This was in early July. It took me 4 months and a complaint to the British Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77. There was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight I won’t ever take with British. Like a bad insurance claim, British just kept denying my claim, expecting that I would just go away. Well, I am going away. I’m taking my $77 and using another airline for future travel.",

Business class seating on this plane and on this route was not worth the $$ in my opinion. There were too many seats in each row making the seats narrower than those offered by other airlines. Most jumbo jets have a 1-2-1 configuration in business class; this plane had 2-3-2 and 2-4-2, twice as many seats in each row. This is particularly obnoxious if you are seated in the middle aisle because that means anyone seated in a window seat or in the middle seats has to crawl over an aisle passenger just to get to the bathroom and back. If you do so in the dark on an overnight flight, it is actually unsafe for you and that poor aisle passenger. Check the plane scheduled for the flight you want to take and if a 777 is offered, opt for that one. They are all equipped with Club Suites in Business now.",

They've installed the same appalling slimline seats easyJet and Wizz Air have, but managed to make them even more uncomfortable. They have no lumbar support, and also don't have headrests like BA's old Pinnacle seats. They also have no recline and despite being refurbished had no at seat charging either. My understanding was that seats upto row 12 should have the old Pinnacle seats, so I woke up early to check-in just as check-in opened on the app 24hrs before and was pleased to bag a seat in row 10 which should mean I have the old Pinnacle seat. Apparently not, at least not on BA Euroflyer their subsidiary at Gatwick, the whole plane had the new appalling slimline seats even in Business - I'd have been pretty appalled if I had paid extra to fly in that cabin and been left with that seat for 3hrs.

         "✅Trip Verified|  Did research, premium economy, looks good with extra width seats more legroom and extra recline on the seats. We had a 20 hour red eye flight LHR to SYD with a refuelling and quick crew change in SIN. Looks deceive. We were seated in row E (middle 2 of 4) centre aisle. Great, until the seat in front reclined and we discovered we were trapped. The seat arms are not retractable, (that is where the tray table is located). The distance between the arm rest and the fully reclined seat in front is under 7 inches. To extract yourself you have to wake 3 passengers, 2 in front to lift their seat backs to an upright position and the passenger to your side to allow you to lift your legs up over the arm rests. I found it impossible to watch my screen due to it being so far off vertical, it was sending me dizzy looking at it. One other problem I discovered, because I was stressed at being uncomfortable I started getting hot to find the Boeing 777 does not have individual air conditioning cold air nozzles, once the temperature is set it can’t be individually cooled. On the positive side the food was good I did however miss the coffee pot after the meal.",

The 1-2-1 configuration is a step up from their 2-3/4-2 configuration and the privacy on the seats is pretty good. The door isn't helpful and is more of a gimmick (could've been higher). The new IFE screens are way better than the older ones, they are more clear and bright and responsive than the old IFE screens. The seats on club suite are still fabric, which in my opinion, is better than leather and more comfortable. The seats now have convenient storage bins and power ports which is a very big improvement when compared to the old club world. The seats also have adjustable armrests which make sliding out of your seat during meal services easy. The service, in general, was fantastic and very similar to other BA flights I've had.

Luckily my seat did not have the IFE box under the seat in front as this robs passengers of further legroom. The recline was ok on the seat and the adjustable headrest could be quite comfortable if there was just another 2 inches of legroom. When the seat in front is reclined however the IFE screen is in your face. Choice of IFE was however very good. The headphone socket in the arm of the seat is very easily damaged due to the location and care is needed if the headphones are left plugged in when leaving your seat. I feel on any long haul flight the passengers in the window and center seat should be able to get out to use the bathroom without disturbing the other passengers in the row.

On the outward JAL flight, the economy cabin seat pitch was decent so plenty of leg room. Also wherever they put the video boxes it wasn't under the seats so plenty of room to move your legs about under the seat. The return flight on BA (787) was a different story. The seat pitch is poor so my knees were practically touching the seat in front. Also, the boxes for the video are under a lot of the seats so a third of my meagre legroom under my seat was taken up by the video box. This makes for an extremely uncomfortable 12 hour flight and impossible to sleep as my legs jammed under the seat prevented me from reclining properly.

         "✅Trip Verified|  Seat 6D, isle seat. Seat was very comfortable with ample leg room while seated or laid flat. Several storage bins available so you could store your personal items. The controls were easy to use and understand. The drawback to this isle seat is the lack of privacy. In BA 787 layout you get one or the other but not both- Privacy or direct isle access. So if this was the overnight flight I wouldn't want such open access to the isle as it would be harder to sleep as people passed by. If you are going to plan to sleep the long flight you might want a window or center seat as they are closed to foot traffic. The other odd thing about the BA layout is you are looking face to face with the person next to you, not a big deal in our case as I was seated next to my travel partner. I will say that like other 787 I've flown, the interior is looking worn and a bit beat up with obvious damage. Overall good seat, good crew, and good flight.",

The seats are not to the latest standards in the industry. Seats feel tight and look tired and forget privacy. Passengers have no privacy except you have the window side seats as the dividers only provide little sense of privacy. But stepping over a passenger on the aisle seat is also not nice when the seat is flat. The IFE system is old with touch screen with poor quality screens which need to pressed really hard to make a selection. Further the content is not much or varied. The plus of flying BA Club World is just more legroom, not sitting in World Traveller or Premium Economy and more luggage allowance. BA Wifi is now also available. Otherwise I think BA Club World is  overpriced for what you get. It is not an amazing experience. The staff was attentive on the way to CPT but not at all on the way back to LGW. Unfortunately BA staff has quite often that attitude that you are a burden to them like \"what do you want from us\". That is not acceptable.

         "✅Trip Verified|  I booked for my wife and myself to fly to Grand Cayman with BA in November 2018. The schedule was Manchester to Heathrow then Heathrow to Grand Cayman and return flights 14 days later so 8 seats in total. At the time of booking I checked emergency exit seats were available on all flights and all seats at emergency exits were available. I am 6’2” and anyone 6’ or over will know the discomfort experienced in a normal pitch seat. BA had prices on all seats so you could reserve the seat you wanted, the seats at the emergency exits where you could see there was more space for your legs were 3 times the price of a normal seat. I paid additional fees for 8 seats at emergency exits. I receive emails from BA in July 2018 to say they had changed my seating allocation but I presumed they had just moved us to another exit seat on a like for like basis. If not I was expecting a refund, the refund never came, so I remained confident we were still seated in a like for like basis. Out of 8 emergency exits seats I paid for, we were only seated in 3. Upon my return I requested a refund from BA for 5 seats I’d paid for at a premium rate, below is their response. Thanks for getting in touch with us about your flight from Manchester on 22 November. You’re clearly disappointed with your seat because it didn’t have as much leg room as you’d expected. I completely understand why you’re feeling let down. I realise you feel you didn't get the seats you'd paid for. The maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board our flights. We can’t guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you’re travelling on. I’m afraid we can’t promise you’ll be able to sit in a particular seat on our aircraft and we do advise this in our General Conditions of Carriage, which you accept when you make your booking. This means I’m unable to offer you a refund on this occasion. I know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for and I’m sorry. I can see why you’re frustrated we didn’t meet your expectations and we’re grateful you've taken the time to let us know how you’re feeling. Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to respond to your concerns. We appreciate your support as a Blue member of our Executive Club. I hope we can welcome you on board again soon. Please feel free to contact me directly using the blue link below if I can help you with anything else. I emailed them back stating I’d paid a premium for extra leg room seats by emergency exits and I expected a refund and this was their reply. I'd like to inform you that we do inform passengers that the seat map is for guidance only and not true to scale. Extra space between rows does not indicate extra legroom. However, any exit row seat may have extra leg room, but we don't sell these seats as extra leg room seats on ba.com. The leg room may vary as per the aircraft seating configuration. I do appreciate your reasons for asking, I'm afraid we cannot refund you the prepaid seating charge. So basically, BA believe if they do not sell seats as extra legroom seats, they can charge you a premium for them, then move you to a seat you’d pay less for and not refund you the difference. The scale argument does not stand up to scrutiny as the seat pitch at emergency exits are more than standard pitch.",

I regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complain to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat. Crew offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working.

Flying on a clearly aging 747 from Heathrow to Miami didn't start things off too well, the seat was very narrow for premium economy, noticeably narrower than Virgin, legroom was fine though. We were greeted with a glass of champagne which was a nice touch, oddly on the return Orlando to Gatwick run we had a choice of orange juice or water, disappointing to say the least. As far as perks go that was it. Food ran out so we ended up with economy food, nice but not fantastic. The back seat TV was old fashioned, small in size compared to other airlines and had a very limited choice, all in all both flights were very disappointing. One other thing we found odd was no toilet in the premium economy area of the 777 from Orlando to Gatwick, we had to use economy class toilets some twenty rows behind us.

The seats had seen better days, and the whole cabin looked quite old and tatty. The screens on the back of the seats in front were tiny and quite difficult to see. In my case it was not functioning correctly anyway, but I'd brought my own entertainment so not really a problem. There was the - now usual - problem of people bringing up to five bags onboard, some of which were large suitcases, so very little room in the overhead lockers for those who'd only brought on one bag. Since our bags fitted under the seat in front this was not an issue. The biggest problem was the meal service. There were theoretically two meal options but since we were at the back of the cabin we were left with the option nobody else wanted: they called it \"spinach and ricotta ravioli\", but it was an inedible slab of dried up pasta and dried up tomato ketchup. On the plus side for us, the first choice, \"Fillet of beef with broccolini\", was also barely edible. In my experience economy gets much better meals than premium economy on most airlines. If travelling premium economy on British Airways, where one of the options is inedible slops, those at the back of the cabin will effectively get no meal because the travellers at the front get first choice. If you're travelling from London you can choose your meal beforehand, which is useful. If you're travelling to London at the back of the cabin bring your own meal with you or you may end up going hungry.",

The control for the in flight entertainment is in the side of the seat so you regularly brush it just sitting in the seat which can turn the entertainment off or pause the video. The screen for the entertainment was amongst the smallest i have seen and much smaller than economy class on other aircraft types. The entertainment kept skipping and had to be reset just after take off which meant no entertainment access for 30 mins. The leg room pitch was pretty good. A lot of the blinds were broken in some way so a lot of light poured into the cabin and as this was an overnight 10 hr flight that was not idea. They need to refurbish these old 747s desperately. The seat power point in word traveller plus is the old empower connection. No one uses this connection type anymore. it needs to be changed. It's like having a car with a CD player.

As we made our way onto the plane (from near the front of the general boarding queue), my perfectly average not heavy not oversized bag (we also had checked baggage) was taken from me to be put in the hold. I don’t know why they selected me as they then allowed practically the rest of the plane to board with their bags. I didn’t have luggage locks - my wife had them and she had boarded in front of me - and when i got on board my wife became upset because her jacket with her wallet had been in my bag because we couldn’t carry everything. She told a surly stewardess with dark hair who couldn’t have cared less. My wife questioned why my bag was taken when people with more luggage than us we being let on and the plane wasn’t completely full and she just said they’re wasn’t enough locker space. Why penalise those who arrive early at the check in then?? We’ve had stuff stolen from hand luggage placed in the BA hold before - which we mentioned to zero interest from the staff. The surly woman then proceeded to bang into my wife throughout the flight as she marched her M&S laden trolley up and down, touting the expansive tat you can buy for much less on the ground. The payment system now means those on the aisle are stuck with someone’s rear end in their faces for much longer as purchases are made, plus trolleys left in the aisle while something is heated up in the galley and trotted back out. The bags that were placed in the hold appeared very last at the baggage claim, adding to our stress. Luckily the wallet was untouched. We fly business as a family numerous times to Australia each year and we never choose BA because of the generally rubbish service on short haul flights. I'd rather spend the big bucks where I can be guaranteed good service (Singapore etc).

The staff try hard but there is little loyalty (they do not work for BA) Information on flights is scarce due to them not working direct and on one occasion they were told by BA to “stop bothering them” when they were trying to ascertain the status of a much delayed flight. Despite the flight having been delayed for over five hours the customers were kicked out of the lounge two hours before boarding as it was closing.

The catering staff in the lounge are nice, polite and helpful - in contrast to the reception BA staff who are rude, abrasive and have no right to be facing customers. The toilets are terrible, long queues to access one, no urinals so all men have to queue up for the single toilets. As with so many other parts of the famous BA cost-cutting, all magazines and newspapers have not been returned after Covid, and this is now a further drop in standards. Food is okay, but hot food is real canteen style and not a match on many airlines first class standards. To call this a \"First\" lounge is a disgrace, and you are probably better off going to one of the restaurants in the main departure hall.

We were shocked to see not one but three mice running under and around our chairs and table. The wait staff told me the lounge is infested with mice and that British Airways and Heathrow Airport have known about this for months. I was so disgusted that I left. I was then told by a flight attendant that their crew lounge is also infested with mice. Lastly, I was told by an airport meet and greet that the problem is not just limited to the British Air lounges. In addition to the active mice, the lounge was very dark, the tables were dirty as was the glassware. Totally disgusting and unacceptable.

The same was true of the staff on the baggage storage desk and the shower suite desk. The shower facilities were in desperate need of refurbishment. As is the lounge in general. The food on offer was quite nice and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed which is what we needed after a very long flight. Bottom line though is BA really need to improve the quality of their staff and give this particular lounge a refresh.",

I did find a really good Sauvignon which exceeded my expectations and only wish that happened more.

I was travelling on an Economy Hand Baggage only flight with a non status friend and he was allowed to enter as my guest. There isn't a huge difference between the Business and the First Class lounge. You still have the British Airways, NHS style Showers and Toilets. Furnishings that aren't too modern and the lack of that truly luxurious feel. But, There is an upgrade in the drinks variety. More premium brands of drinks. This visit was during Covid and so you had to order food and snacks by scanning a QR code, entering your table number and placing your order. BA lounges have never been truly luxurious, If you have one world status you are better off visiting the likes of Cathay Pacific whose bathrooms are beautifully designed, tiled and contain Aesop products. But if you want an English Breakfast for instance. BA is your best bet.",

This lounge is used by Aer Lingus and other OneWorld Elites which make this lounge crowded, especially in the evening. The snack options in the lounge are decent and something you can work with. This lounge has no windows and very low ceilings which make it gloomy. Club Dining is a nice option and highly recommended, it's less crowded than the rest of the lounge because of restricted access and a good choice of hot food in response to BA's sleeper service.",

To be honest, the previous First lounge was something of an embarrassment, with too few seats and general feeling of being cramped. The new arrangement eschews a separate First lounge but allocates a separate First dining area. This seems to work reasonably well. The rest of the lounge is by no means spacious but there are adequate seats to accommodation the Club and First passengers on the two evening flights to LHR. The food seems to substantially better than before, with regular refreshes of both hot and cold food. The bar area is spacious as bar areas go and service was good. Overall, the new Galleries Lounge is a definite improvement for Club passengers; First passengers may not agree, of course.",

The catering was fantastic with plenty of options for food and beverages with plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy it. Customer service was average, lounge team were present and making sure food was plentiful plus consistently tidying but lack face to face service.

We had to wait until other passengers left. The food was poor - a couple of types of wrap and some crispy egg sandwiches on rye plus soup and a tired tray of salad ingredients. We discovered subsequently that the food in the main area was fresher - probably due to the high number of people.The only nibbles were wasabi peas, stale pretzels and a variety of different sweets.

Despite flying on the first evening service of the day, the lounge wasn't busy, and it's very spacious. There's a view of the apron from the far end with large windows and bar style seating next to them. Near the entrance is the usual self service bar and snacks, similar to the BA Galleries lounges in Heathrow and Gatwick. Down the far end, however, is a full service bar. The staff there were fantastic, and constantly brought me over another drink as soon as they saw my glass was empty. Pre flight dining is available from 5pm from a buffet, which had a good selection and the food was nice. There's also a Concorde dining area for F passengers. The real bonus with this lounge is that you board the aircraft directly from the lounge, which is positioned above the boarding gate. The staff were all fantastic, so friendly and obliging. This is quite possibly the best BA lounge I've experienced - I'd easily rate it above the flagship Concorde Room! It's that good!",

Food is self-service and includes a fair selection of hot and cold options. Drinks are limited in choice and champagne is Larssen rather than Laurent Perrier. Unfortunately, because of the compact size of the space, loud transatlantic smartphone conversations can easily disturb the peace.",

         "✅Trip Verified|  The Club World and First Galleries Lounge at Johannesburg has been the subject of much needed refurbishment and reflects a new harmonised policy for housing both classes under one roof without as overt a distinction as before. To be honest, the previous First lounge was something of an embarrassment, with too few seats and general feeling of being cramped. The new arrangement eschews a separate First lounge but allocates a separate First dining area. This seems to work reasonably well. The rest of the lounge is by no means spacious but there are adequate seats to accommodation the Club and First passengers on the two evening flights to LHR. The food seems to substantially better than before, with regular refreshes of both hot and cold food. The bar area is spacious as bar areas go and service was good. Overall, the new Galleries Lounge is a definite improvement for Club passengers; First passengers may not agree, of course.",

The catering was fantastic with plenty of options for food and beverages with plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy it.

We had to wait until other passengers left. The food was poor - a couple of types of wrap and some crispy egg sandwiches on rye plus soup and a tired tray of salad ingredients. We discovered subsequently that the food in the main area was fresher - probably due to the high number of people.The only nibbles were wasabi peas, stale pretzels and a variety of different sweets.

Despite flying on the first evening service of the day, the lounge wasn't busy, and it's very spacious. There's a view of the apron from the far end with large windows and bar style seating next to them. Near the entrance is the usual self service bar and snacks, similar to the BA Galleries lounges in Heathrow and Gatwick. Down the far end, however, is a full service bar. The staff there were fantastic, and constantly brought me over another drink as soon as they saw my glass was empty. Pre flight dining is available from 5pm from a buffet, which had a good selection and the food was nice. There's also a Concorde dining area for F passengers. The real bonus with this lounge is that you board the aircraft directly from the lounge, which is positioned above the boarding gate. The staff were all fantastic, so friendly and obliging.

For a flight with 72+ Business Class seats there is barely enough space for this many people and certainly not comfortably. It's cramped and faces the evening sun so very warm. The choice of 'food' is very minimal. The bar is served through a hatch with a queue every time for a drink and a limited selection. There are less bathrooms in this lounge than on the aircraft so time your visit carefully.",

         "Not Verified|   Recently flew BA’s nonstop between Boston and London on the A380. It is a massive airplane with a payload of over 500 passengers. Business class seating on this plane and on this route was not worth the $$ in my opinion. There were too many seats in each row making the seats narrower than those offered by other airlines. Most jumbo jets have a 1-2-1 configuration in business class; this plane had 2-3-2 and 2-4-2, twice as many seats in each row. This is particularly obnoxious if you are seated in the middle aisle because that means anyone seated in a window seat or in the middle seats has to crawl over an aisle passenger just to get to the bathroom and back. If you do so in the dark on an overnight flight, it is actually unsafe for you and that poor aisle passenger. Check the plane scheduled for the flight you want to take and if a 777 is offered, opt for that one. They are all equipped with Club Suites in Business now.",

They've installed the same appalling slimline seats easyJet and Wizz Air have, but managed to make them even more uncomfortable. They have no lumbar support, and also don't have headrests like BA's old Pinnacle seats. They also have no recline and despite being refurbished had no at seat charging either. My understanding was that seats upto row 12 should have the old Pinnacle seats, so I woke up early to check-in just as check-in opened on the app 24hrs before and was pleased to bag a seat in row 10 which should mean I have the old Pinnacle seat. Apparently not, at least not on BA Euroflyer their subsidiary at Gatwick, the whole plane had the new appalling slimline seats even in Business - I'd have been pretty appalled if I had paid extra to fly in that cabin and been left with that seat for 3hrs.

         "✅Trip Verified|  Did research, premium economy, looks good with extra width seats more legroom and extra recline on the seats. We had a 20 hour red eye flight LHR to SYD with a refuelling and quick crew change in SIN. Looks deceive. We were seated in row E (middle 2 of 4) centre aisle. Great, until the seat in front reclined and we discovered we were trapped. The seat arms are not retractable, (that is where the tray table is located). The distance between the arm rest and the fully reclined seat in front is under 7 inches. To extract yourself you have to wake 3 passengers, 2 in front to lift their seat backs to an upright position and the passenger to your side to allow you to lift your legs up over the arm rests. I found it impossible to watch my screen due to it being so far off vertical, it was sending me dizzy looking at it. One other problem I discovered, because I was stressed at being uncomfortable I started getting hot to find the Boeing 777 does not have individual air conditioning cold air nozzles, once the temperature is set it can’t be individually cooled. On the positive side the food was good I did however miss the coffee pot after the meal.",

The 1-2-1 configuration is a step up from their 2-3/4-2 configuration and the privacy on the seats is pretty good. The door isn't helpful and is more of a gimmick (could've been higher). The new IFE screens are way better than the older ones, they are more clear and bright and responsive than the old IFE screens. The seats on club suite are still fabric, which in my opinion, is better than leather and more comfortable. The seats now have convenient storage bins and power ports which is a very big improvement when compared to the old club world. The seats also have adjustable armrests which make sliding out of your seat during meal services easy. The service, in general, was fantastic and very similar to other BA flights I've had.

Luckily my seat did not have the IFE box under the seat in front as this robs passengers of further legroom. The recline was ok on the seat and the adjustable headrest could be quite comfortable if there was just another 2 inches of legroom. When the seat in front is reclined however the IFE screen is in your face. Choice of IFE was however very good. The headphone socket in the arm of the seat is very easily damaged due to the location and care is needed if the headphones are left plugged in when leaving your seat. I feel on any long haul flight the passengers in the window and center seat should be able to get out to use the bathroom without disturbing the other passengers in the row.

On the outward JAL flight, the economy cabin seat pitch was decent so plenty of leg room. Also wherever they put the video boxes it wasn't under the seats so plenty of room to move your legs about under the seat. The return flight on BA (787) was a different story. The seat pitch is poor so my knees were practically touching the seat in front. Also, the boxes for the video are under a lot of the seats so a third of my meagre legroom under my seat was taken up by the video box. This makes for an extremely uncomfortable 12 hour flight and impossible to sleep as my legs jammed under the seat prevented me from reclining properly.

         "✅Trip Verified|  Seat 6D, isle seat. Seat was very comfortable with ample leg room while seated or laid flat. Several storage bins available so you could store your personal items. The controls were easy to use and understand. The drawback to this isle seat is the lack of privacy. In BA 787 layout you get one or the other but not both- Privacy or direct isle access. So if this was the overnight flight I wouldn't want such open access to the isle as it would be harder to sleep as people passed by. If you are going to plan to sleep the long flight you might want a window or center seat as they are closed to foot traffic. The other odd thing about the BA layout is you are looking face to face with the person next to you, not a big deal in our case as I was seated next to my travel partner. I will say that like other 787 I've flown, the interior is looking worn and a bit beat up with obvious damage. Overall good seat, good crew, and good flight.",

The seats are not to the latest standards in the industry. Seats feel tight and look tired and forget privacy. Passengers have no privacy except you have the window side seats as the dividers only provide little sense of privacy. But stepping over a passenger on the aisle seat is also not nice when the seat is flat. The IFE system is old with touch screen with poor quality screens which need to pressed really hard to make a selection. Further the content is not much or varied. The plus of flying BA Club World is just more legroom, not sitting in World Traveller or Premium Economy and more luggage allowance. BA Wifi is now also available. Otherwise I think BA Club World is  overpriced for what you get. It is not an amazing experience. The staff was attentive on the way to CPT but not at all on the way back to LGW. Unfortunately BA staff has quite often that attitude that you are a burden to them like \"what do you want from us\". That is not acceptable.

         "✅Trip Verified|  I booked for my wife and myself to fly to Grand Cayman with BA in November 2018. The schedule was Manchester to Heathrow then Heathrow to Grand Cayman and return flights 14 days later so 8 seats in total. At the time of booking I checked emergency exit seats were available on all flights and all seats at emergency exits were available. I am 6’2” and anyone 6’ or over will know the discomfort experienced in a normal pitch seat. BA had prices on all seats so you could reserve the seat you wanted, the seats at the emergency exits where you could see there was more space for your legs were 3 times the price of a normal seat. I paid additional fees for 8 seats at emergency exits. I receive emails from BA in July 2018 to say they had changed my seating allocation but I presumed they had just moved us to another exit seat on a like for like basis. If not I was expecting a refund, the refund never came, so I remained confident we were still seated in a like for like basis. Out of 8 emergency exits seats I paid for, we were only seated in 3. Upon my return I requested a refund from BA for 5 seats I’d paid for at a premium rate, below is their response. Thanks for getting in touch with us about your flight from Manchester on 22 November. You’re clearly disappointed with your seat because it didn’t have as much leg room as you’d expected. I completely understand why you’re feeling let down. I realise you feel you didn't get the seats you'd paid for. The maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board our flights. We can’t guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you’re travelling on. I’m afraid we can’t promise you’ll be able to sit in a particular seat on our aircraft and we do advise this in our General Conditions of Carriage, which you accept when you make your booking. This means I’m unable to offer you a refund on this occasion. I know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for and I’m sorry. I can see why you’re frustrated we didn’t meet your expectations and we’re grateful you've taken the time to let us know how you’re feeling. Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to respond to your concerns. We appreciate your support as a Blue member of our Executive Club. I hope we can welcome you on board again soon. Please feel free to contact me directly using the blue link below if I can help you with anything else. I emailed them back stating I’d paid a premium for extra leg room seats by emergency exits and I expected a refund and this was their reply. I'd like to inform you that we do inform passengers that the seat map is for guidance only and not true to scale. Extra space between rows does not indicate extra legroom. However, any exit row seat may have extra leg room, but we don't sell these seats as extra leg room seats on ba.com. The leg room may vary as per the aircraft seating configuration. I do appreciate your reasons for asking, I'm afraid we cannot refund you the prepaid seating charge. So basically, BA believe if they do not sell seats as extra legroom seats, they can charge you a premium for them, then move you to a seat you’d pay less for and not refund you the difference. The scale argument does not stand up to scrutiny as the seat pitch at emergency exits are more than standard pitch.",

I regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complain to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat. Crew offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets at all time.  Crews were friendly and helpful. No fault with that.",

Flying on a clearly aging 747 from Heathrow to Miami didn't start things off too well, the seat was very narrow for premium economy, noticeably narrower than Virgin, legroom was fine though. We were greeted with a glass of champagne which was a nice touch, oddly on the return Orlando to Gatwick run we had a choice of orange juice or water, disappointing to say the least. As far as perks go that was it. Food ran out so we ended up with economy food, nice but not fantastic. The back seat TV was old fashioned, small in size compared to other airlines and had a very limited choice, all in all both flights were very disappointing. One other thing we found odd was no toilet in the premium economy area of the 777 from Orlando to Gatwick, we had to use economy class toilets some twenty rows behind us.

         "✅Trip Verified|  I travelled from Houston to London Heathrow in premium economy. The seat itself was quite comfortable, with a good seat pitch and a decent recline (we were in the back row so didn't need to worry about ruining someone else's journey by reclining into their faces). The seats had seen better days, and the whole cabin looked quite old and tatty. The screens on the back of the seats in front were tiny and quite difficult to see. In my case it was not functioning correctly anyway, but I'd brought my own entertainment so not really a problem. There was the - now usual - problem of people bringing up to five bags onboard, some of which were large suitcases, so very little room in the overhead lockers for those who'd only brought on one bag. Since our bags fitted under the seat in front this was not an issue. The biggest problem was the meal service. There were theoretically two meal options but since we were at the back of the cabin we were left with the option nobody else wanted: they called it \"spinach and ricotta ravioli\", but it was an inedible slab of dried up pasta and dried up tomato ketchup. On the plus side for us, the first choice, \"Fillet of beef with broccolini\", was also barely edible. In my experience economy gets much better meals than premium economy on most airlines. If travelling premium economy on British Airways, where one of the options is inedible slops, those at the back of the cabin will effectively get no meal because the travellers at the front get first choice. If you're travelling from London you can choose your meal beforehand, which is useful. If you're travelling to London at the back of the cabin bring your own meal with you or you may end up going hungry.",

The control for the in flight entertainment is in the side of the seat so you regularly brush it just sitting in the seat which can turn the entertainment off or pause the video. The screen for the entertainment was amongst the smallest i have seen and much smaller than economy class on other aircraft types. The entertainment kept skipping and had to be reset just after take off which meant no entertainment access for 30 mins. The leg room pitch was pretty good. A lot of the blinds were broken in some way so a lot of light poured into the cabin and as this was an overnight 10 hr flight that was not idea. They need to refurbish these old 747s desperately. The seat power point in word traveller plus is the old empower connection. No one uses this connection type anymore. it needs to be changed. It's like having a car with a CD player.

As we made our way onto the plane (from near the front of the general boarding queue), my perfectly average not heavy not oversized bag (we also had checked baggage) was taken from me to be put in the hold. I don’t know why they selected me as they then allowed practically the rest of the plane to board with their bags. I didn’t have luggage locks - my wife had them and she had boarded in front of me - and when i got on board my wife became upset because her jacket with her wallet had been in my bag because we couldn’t carry everything. She told a surly stewardess with dark hair who couldn’t have cared less. My wife questioned why my bag was taken when people with more luggage than us we being let on and the plane wasn’t completely full and she just said they’re wasn’t enough locker space. Why penalise those who arrive early at the check in then?? We’ve had stuff stolen from hand luggage placed in the BA hold before - which we mentioned to zero interest from the staff. The surly woman then proceeded to bang into my wife throughout the flight as she marched her M&S laden trolley up and down, touting the expansive tat you can buy for much less on the ground. The payment system now means those on the aisle are stuck with someone’s rear end in their faces for much longer as purchases are made, plus trolleys left in the aisle while something is heated up in the galley and trotted back out. The bags that were placed in the hold appeared very last at the baggage claim, adding to our stress. Luckily the wallet was untouched. We fly business as a family numerous times to Australia each year and we never choose BA because of the generally rubbish service on short haul flights. I'd rather spend the big bucks where I can be guaranteed good service (Singapore etc).

         "✅Trip Verified|   Flight mainly let down by a disagreeable flight attendant. No queue to check in at Cape Town - good. However checkin agent was unfamiliar with BA size and weight rules for sports bags so had to wait 10 minutes while phone calls were made -- annoying. Lounge was good. Gate service was excellent with organised queues. Seat was good (the new upgraded Club Suite). The zip broke off the amenity kit so it was unusable -- BA cutting corners too much here. Offered a cocktail service which came promptly and the drink was excellent. But no nuts! So I went off to the galley to ask for some nuts or a snack to go with it. I spoke to a male flight attendant who looked at me with utter distaste that I had the temerity to ask for nuts. The he said \"where have you come from?\". What a bizarre question. I said \"seat 8E\" to which he responded with a flick of his hand - \"go ask her, she's serving you.\" I was stunned - I have not been treated that way in even the cheapest restaurants, let alone business class on a premium airline. The gentlemen concerned has no place in service or hospitality and should find a different line of work. Anyway, the food was good. The IFE worked fine. WiFi wasn't working. I managed 6.5 hours sleep and we got off the plane promptly despite being at a remote stand, requiring a bus. The luggage took quite a while to arrive. Overall 7/10. Would be 9/10 but for the rude staff member.",

By contrast the same staff member looked the other way to a boisterous group of 20 somethings all of whom had large amounts of luggage. London Gatwick to Marrakech with British Airways was rather disappointing. The flight is just over 3 hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits. No water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. She claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering. There was no route map on this A320. The captain made only 2 very brief announcements. When I needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues – they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory. I shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor. One concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration. Disembarkation was not well managed either. This route is very competitive and these days one has a lot of choice. I will not use British Airways on this route.",

Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied. Every time I contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them.",

The not so good news I’m afraid to say was the flight itself. The food has really gone downhill since my last flight, presumably this is a cost cutting measure. If other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why can’t an airline of BA’s stature? I’ve always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time. The crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions. They couldn’t even be bothered to say cheerio, and I’m not sure I would have answered if they did. Here’s hoping my return is a more satisfying experience.",

         "✅Trip Verified| I left for London from Johannesburg at 21:15 on 22 December 2024. My only issue with that flight was the pillows they gave us were dirty and when my 7 year old dropped some juice and I asked a cabin crew member walking past for some serviettes she told me to go to the bathroom to get some to clean it up. Those issues weren’t pleasant but certainly not a major problem. I was booked on the BA0057 at 21:15 on 31 December 2024 to return to Johannesburg. The flight was delayed to the 1 January 2025 at 12:00pm. I had a connecting flight to Durban and do not live in Johannesburg. Landing in Johannesburg with 3 children at 1 am was not an option for me. BA changed my flight to 2nd January 2025 at 18:25. I requested a sooner date so I could get home sooner. I was given 1 January 2025 at 21:15. I accepted this as this is the original time I opted for and would he most convenient for me as I was doing a connection in Johannesburg to Durban. Unfortunately this flight was delayed till 2nd January at 17:00. I was extremely upset by this as I was absolutely exhausted and had 3 children who were absolutely exhausted. I also suffer from eczema and hay fever and did not have my creams and medication. This caused my eczema to flare up so badly, even my lips were cracked and burning. My allergies were so severe that my eyes were sticking together and I couldn’t stop sneezing. My daughter also has eczema and has had a flare up. The staff had no sympathy or empathy for a mother traveling alone and her children. I was just told that they know it’s an inconvenience and a lady even snapped at me that they trying their best. My children are 4, 7 and 11 and we were all booked on separate seats. Is that even legal let alone ethical? They were refusing to help me and saying they can’t do anything. I approached 3 people, and the third person finally put us together. So they could clearly help me??? My flight from Johannesburg to Durban was originally booked on South African Airways and I paid a lot for this ticket as South African Airways is not a low cost airline. I was given a cheap low cost Airline, CemAir, which I had never even heard of, to replace my SAA flight. I suffer from flight anxiety and this is why I never book low cost airlines with tiny flights. My anxiety went through the roof on the flight! Besides all of this, I am also left with a huge credit card bill as I used up all my pounds on the 1st! I know BA is obliged to compensate me for the inconvenience under EU law but besides the compensation BA staff really needs to show more empathy for their passengers, like me, who had two hours long flight delays two days in a row and was alone with 3 children. I expect my full compensation for all of us as this has been by far the worst experience I have had traveling. All their staff kept saying is “that’s why you will get compensation.” I am now waiting to see if I get compensated as I was promised by all of their ground staff! Legally they have to under EU law, so let’s see if they put up a fight or do what is ethical and legal.",

BA have moved the Business Class checkin from one end of the hall to the other at T5 for no apparent reason so a nice long walk to check in. Fast Track security was very slow (15 minutes). The indicator board suggested the South Lounge was \"half full\" but when I went it was uncomfortably full and it is still tatty as not refurbished, so I went to the B Pier lounge instead. Much better except as usual the staff are sort of trying to pack up early and have a bizarre way of refilling the food containers which involves actually removing them to the kitchen (which means they are gone a lot of the time) rather than replenishing them customer side. Very employee-centric behaviour. Time for the flight so down to the transit to take us to the C Gates. Except the transit had decided not to stop any more at the B Gates so we watched five maybe seven transits pass through without stopping. Eventually me and a group of maybe 15 other passengers of mixed ages decided to descend to the walkway and run all the way to the C Gates. We all arrived soaked in sweat - not a nice start to a long business class flight. The A380 is spacious but the seat is outdated now and in urgent need of replacement. IFE was not working and had to be rebooted. The headphone prong was bent so headphones not working. The USB port was not working. Drinks were brought out promptly. Starter (salmon) was delicious - truly excellent. Beef was tough ... I think a bad piece of meat rather than badly cooked. Wines were good. Cheese was average to good. Staff were friendly. Good night's sleep. Breakfast good. The recheck experience at JNB is a huge hassle - there is a giant screen saying \"Domestic recheck\" and a queue but when you get to the front of the queue you are told it is SAFAIR only and not for SAA, BA's local partner. What a hassle. Why aren't we warned or told this ... loads of BA passengers making the same mistake. Overall 5/10. It's the little things that would make this better: fast track actually fast track. Refurbish the South Lounge. Have food replenishment in the passenger area, not the kitchen; make sure the transits stop, even late in the evening; refurbish the A380s; ask Do & Co (who are generally excellent by the way) to monitor meat quality rigorously.",

They know this prior and did not inform passengers until after we had boarded. The flight home took nearly 6 hours due to weather conditions, this plus 2 hours waiting. What did BA offer during this 8 hour hell flight, 3 oatmeal biscuits and 250ml of water for our family. When I went to the cabin crew to ask for more water, which I was told there wasn’t any 3 out of the 4 cabin crew were asleep in the back row seats of the aircraft BA621 on 23/11/24. This infuriated me further as I had previously asked if there were any spare seats so that my 2 year old could spread out and get some sleep if available. I was told the flight was full. After we arrived late my connecting flight had now been missed. We then queued at the connections desk in a large queue only to watch the BA staff clock off for the night in front of us. No genuine support was given to me, or my family and we were effectively abandoned by BA. I’ve tried to speak to someone, but their helpline has an automated message saying due to the number of calls (not surprised by that aspect) they cant assist me, then hang up. Tried this several times at various times. I think it’s their default message. Have raised this via their email system. Unsurprisingly been mugged off and can’t escalate until 8 weeks have passed.

But not only that, Heathrow airport, their hub, is by far the worst large airport I’ve seen in Europe. When we landed in DC I had an email saying that my luggage stayed in London. This was last Wednesday. I have an AirTag so I could follow my suitcase. It came to Washington the following day, Thursday. Ever since, it’s been sitting in the airport. British offers no means of communication: the online chat is a bot. The bot tells me to call a number in England. I did. It’s another bot. When you say you have in inquiry about luggage it sends you a link via SMS and hangs up. No option to talk to a human. In the claim form they gave me there’s a local phone, which reaches a voicemail. I keep calling them (6 times today only) and leaving messages, saying that the AirTag shows the suitcase in IAD and offering to go pick it up so they don’t need to deliver it. No one replies to the voicemail. So basically I am shut out, with no luggage, no information, no customer service and no one to talk to.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   Pretty good flight but still some small things that can be improved. Check in was quick. Lounge was good - tasty food and well chosen wines. Disappointingly they had not secured a gate so we had to bus to the aircraft and it was all a hot scrum. I got the last bus to avoid the crush. Emirates, Turkish, Lufthansa, Qatar all had planes on gates ... why not BA? Penny-pinching? Then it turned out the cabin crew forgot about those on the last bus so I had to ask for a welcome drink. It came and the champagne was actually cold. Well done BA ... first time they managed to serve champagne cold in my 10 years of flying with them. Big improvement. Cabin and seat were lovely as always (I greatly prefer to the Emirates white/gold bling). Drinks service was prompt. IFE was good. Starter (trout) was OK. Main (chicken) was excellent. Cheese was sold not cold (as it should be). Wines were excellent. We were not disturbed through the night so got a good sleep on a comfy bed. Cabin was a bit too warm though for my personal preference. Was woken up (as asked) and served a tasty breakfast. Small detail - as it is impossible to get water to 100C at altitude maybe BA could warm the ceramic coffee cups so coffee retains its heat a bit longer? Pouring not quite hot coffee into a nice (but cold) china mug means it is lukewarm instantly. Off the plane in record time (2 minutes) after parking. Bags were waiting for us on the belt. Excellent work by the ground staff. Overall 8/10. Improvement points: gate not bus to the plane; don't forget passengers on the last bus or who board late (but well before pushback). Standout cabin crew member was \"Miguel\" - what a star.",

The crew were fantastic, and I’m starting to really see some consistency in the quality of their first class crew. The drink selection was fine. The food was appalling. We were the victims of their new supper service. This is basically a dinner service with a lot less options/choice. No fish/seafood options on either the starters or the mains.

There was another KLM flight to Amsterdam scheduled to depart at the same time. It took off on time and another KLM flight to Amsterdam later the evening also took off without any problems. It's just the one operated by British Airways was cancelled because of 'the bad weather'. Apparently, the weather was so bad that every plane could land and take off successfully apart from theirs.

It's the insane saga of events that proceeded to claim the compensation that I'm legally entitled to according to EU rules. Used their claims page and all was OK. It was from there that it became incomprehensibly frustrating. My case was closed but no confirmation of what the conclusion was or any money. I tried calling but kept being lead in circles; customer services can't speak to the claims team, the claims team can't be spoken to directly, customer service don't have access to the claims team's system and so on. 4 calls later and 'nothing could be done'. I had to throw my toys out of the pram on the last call and someone finally updated me. I thought that was the end; they had confirmed the claim and that I would be transferred what I was due. And then, they got the amount wrong. I wrote to they to highlight this and they said that they would rectify it. Almost 1 month since the original flight was cancelled and still haven't received what is owed to me as compensation for my wife and son. I have sent two more emails in the last two days and I've yet to get a response. It is criminal that they are not adhering to the aviation rules that dictate compensation for cancelled flights.

Soon after I started to get emails saying my selected seats (I paid extra for the selection) had been changed by BA without any reason given and I was directed to the website. There I found no information on the said seat change. This happened several times (I had 4 flights altogether). The website seems to be a digital dinosaur. The first leg of my flight was fine, until I discovered in the transfer area at Heathrow that I forgot my new laptop onboard. Immediately I contacted BA's so called Customer Service (what an oxymoron), which basically said they can not do anything, I would have to wait until the cleaners (working for a contractor) would have finished their job and hope they would discover the laptop and return it to so called Lost & Found at the airport. BA's customer service said they couldn't contact their colleagues in the terminal/gate were the plane was still and let them know there was a lost laptop by seat no 27A of the plane (yes I told them exactly were the laptop was). They wouldn't take any contact details either to notify me if and when the laptop would be returned and they refused to register the incident. They simply had no interest in assisting me and didn't even make an attempt to pretend they did. Communication via their online customer service was poor, and they didn't even respond to my messages. In the end I emailed the representative at Heathrow and he replied with a message form his supervisor (which did not reveal his name): \"It is not the duty of British Airways to find lost property on behalf of our passengers, however if you would like to dispute this you can contact customer relations online with further feedback.\" They took no responsibility and referred me to Smartecarte, which is the contractor cleaning their planes and apparently collecting lost items at Heathrow. I have not received the laptop, worth 2 thousand GBP, back now 3 weeks later. The flights between London and Cape Town (~12 hours), were unpleasant. The flight attendants were seemingly unenthusiastic about their job, it took up to an hour to collect the trash after the meal, which also was distributed extremely slowly. Food was not good. Boarding was slow and inefficient. Drinks were only offered twice (otherwise you'd have to ask for it especially) on this long flights. The seats were of fabric, uncomfortable and room too scarce to relax and sleep. All in all flying with British Airways was disappointing and I will not be keen on flying with them again.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   Singapore to Heathrow with BA. Two choices on this route A380 or 777-300. In economy and premium (and first) there isn’t much in it. In club world the 777 wins as it has the suite. Check in was easy. Security and passport control in Singapore is efficient. Choice of 3 lounges (BA, Qantas or Qatar) the latter wins easily. BA lounge was ok no major negatives. Qantas wins on space. Boarding was on time. The aircraft has a high density club world cabin. Service was fine. Club suite was good. It’s the food and beverages that are being targeted I feel. The 1st meal starter was good, main of beef fillet was average, same sentiment for cheese. Wines were acceptable. Champagne choice is cheap so I did not try. Service for meals efficient given the full cabin. Breakfast was similar. The menu suggested that some might want to skip a main course and opt for starter and dessert, for this to work for BA, a major shift in how lounge options are sourced and presented would be needed. As it was I slept well, we arrived early, luggage off quickly (for once) so a reasonable flight overall. My warning to BA is that food and beverages in club world are drifting in the wrong direction",

         "✅Trip Verified|   I recently travelled from Munich to London with British Airways, and it turned into an absolute nightmare. Our troubles began with their malfunctioning app. Despite checking in successfully, I was unable to retrieve our boarding passes. Upon arrival at the airport, we discovered that there were no self-service kiosks, and the check-in desks were completely unattended. After seeking help from the information desk, we were directed to a staff member who clearly did not want to assist us. Her dismissive attitude was infuriating, and despite showing her the app indicating we were checked in, she simply told us to call customer service and walked away without providing any assistance. After being put on hold for 25 minutes and being sent to several different staff members who couldn’t help us, we finally reached someone on the phone who was kind but ultimately powerless to resolve our issue. By this point, our flight was delayed, and we had wasted two hours just trying to print our boarding passes. When I followed up with a complaint, British Airways basically dismissed my concerns and told me to use the app next time—ignoring the fact that it was the app's failure that caused all these problems in the first place! This experience cost us a staggering £682.43 in additional expenses, including new flights, hotel stays, taxi fares, and fines. Missing work and explaining this absurd situation to my employer was incredibly embarrassing. British Airways clearly needs to improve its customer service and technology. If their app and website are going to fail, they must provide adequate support at the airport. I will never fly with them again, and I urge others to consider alternative airlines.",

         "Not Verified|  I paid for seats 80 A and B on my flight from Heathrow to Boston on the A380, paying for premium economy seats. Upon arrival at the airport the ticket agent said I was not healthy enough to sit in the purchased seats due to being too old I presume (65) since there is no other reason I can find I could not sit in the exit seating. I am healthy enough to walk 10-12 miles a day and have adequate upper body strength. Attempting to convince her just got us stuck in a cattle call seat, at the rear of the aircraft, second floor and in the middle two seats of the row. We were told our money would be refunded immediately for the \"inconvenience\". After several weeks I recontacted BA and they said the complaint went to the wrong section and they were forwarding it to the next section. 6 weeks later and we still have not heard any updates except for a computer response stating most refunds were returned in 3 weeks, keep waiting. The plane then had ground difficulties and needed a quick repair. They completed that 30 minutes later and boarded the flight. The captain then came on and said it looks like they forgot to order the ground crew to back us out of the terminal and we needed to wait another 30 minutes. We were not able to make up for the lost time in the air. We landed 1.5 hours later than scheduled, wreaking havoc with our next flight.",

         "✅Trip Verified|  I decided to treat myself and my teenage daughter to World Traveller Plus on the return leg of our Canada holiday, paying hundreds of pounds extra to do so... only to end up spending nine and a half hours trapped in a broken seat staring at a blank screen after both our entertainment systems failed to work. I hadn't bought a book or uploaded a film because I had assumed I would be enjoying the entertainment BA had promised. So I decided to lie back and get some rest instead, only to discover that the leg rest on my seat didn't work. The flight attendant was able to prop it up manually by shoving things underneath, but unfortunately this only made matters worse because it became firmly stuck in the up position, forcing my body into an awkward position during the descent, when I had to keep my seatback upright, leaving me with back pain that lasted three days (I have a bad lower back). Early on in this experience I asked to be moved to economy so that I could sit normally and watch a film, but the flight was full and there was no space. The apologetic flight attendant assured me I would receive compensation, which I assumed meant the airline would, at the very least, upgrade us the next time we flew BA, since we had been unable to enjoy any of the advertised benefits of World Traveller Plus (the two of us only had one suitcase each, so hadn't made use of the extra baggage allowance). BA's actual compensation offer: £25 worth of Avios points each. I wrote back (since BA doesn't allow you to have any direct telephone contact with their complaints department) explaining firmly but politely that this was not fair or acceptable, given the hundreds of extra pounds I'd paid for added extras the airline had failed to deliver. They then ghosted me. My experience is a cautionary tale about British Airways customer support. If all goes to plan, you may well have a very pleasant World Traveller Plus experience. But if anything should go wrong, support staff will wash their hands of you and your money will have been wasted. So unless you're prepared to gamble, I would advise you to either stick with Economy/World Traveller (since then you're only really paying to fly from A to B, which they do manage to do) or fly with another airline. Or you could end up like me: throwing away extra money on an experience that fell far below the standard of economy class. If your flight is to Canada, I would recommend an airline such as Air Canada, which I turned to during the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic because of their exceptional customer service and fast, no-nonsense refunds. They do cost a bit more, so when life returned to normal post-Covid, I started flying BA again, believing such high standards of customer service were no longer important. I now see that this was both a mistake and a false economy - one that has ended up costing me hundreds of wasted pounds.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   On arriving at Mexico Airport we were told that the flight was delayed because the aircraft had broken down and the replacement aircraft from LHR was about six hours late. When we eventually managed to check in we told that – contrary to the BA website – we could not have access to the 24-hour Grand Lounge Elite and instead would use the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge which would close three hours before the flight left. After that we would have to use a restaurant and were given a food voucher. Two hours before the flight was due to leave were then informed that the aircraft had diverted to Cancun because of a “volcanic ash cloud over Mexico City” – although it did not appear to be affecting other flights into the airport including those from Europe. They eventually arranged taxis to take us to a hotel and we arrived at 1.30am. We were assured that we would all be on a BA flight leaving the same time the following day. The only contact after that was a local employee who stayed at the hotel. He said that he was there to organise transport and refused to give us any other contact details. (When we eventually did need transport the following day he had disappeared.) During the night, we were then sent an email telling us that we were booked onto an Air Canada flight leaving at 6.30am. This would have been impossible with such short notice and without Canadian EPA authorisation. We then spent two hours trying to make contact with BA – its Mexico number did not work and eventually we were put on an Aeromexico flight in economy. They told us to check in as soon as we could but this meant we had to pay an extra £200 for the seats. Later, after a very long call, we were told that we could be upgraded to business with Aeromexico despite having been told earlier that there was no availability. BA then informed us that because we had already checked in – as they had suggested – we could not be moved and this took three more calls to Aeromexico to sort out. I totally understand that aircraft break down but the onus should be on the airline to rearrange and not the passengers. We were lucky because we took the trouble of making the calls to the UK but others – such as a disabled lady – had been told nothing when we left.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   I have flown British Airways for many years and still do so regularly. In one of my last flights this past summer between Paris and Boston, British booked me on a connecting flight between Paris and London that gave me a maximum of 90 minutes to connect in London. London Heathrow is a massive airport where going from terminal to terminal could take 20-30 minutes once you deplane, not including the actual time to deplane if you are seated in the back and lines at passport control and security between terminals. So already, one is pressed for time. My flight from Paris to London that day was tardy, 49 minutes tardy that day to be exact. BA Flight 323 in fact, is routinely tardy. – don’t bother with this one. Flight Connections assisted me by calling the new gate to let them know my previous flight had been delayed and that I was rushing to the gate. It was 30 minutes before my connecting flight was to depart. I ran like a fool for 25 minutes, carryons and all, arriving to the gate 5 minutes before my flight was to depart, only to be greeted by no plane. The agent said that since no one knew where I was (false) the plane left without me – early. Gaining a few minutes was more important than an passenger inconvenienced by their own delay. So I made the 20 minute trek back to Flight Connections knowing that they would have to rebook me the following day. I was now going to miss the wedding I was destined to attend in Boston. They sent me to a prepaid Hilton hotel room for the night but told me that I would have to pay 30 pounds each way for a taxi to take me there. They gave me a pamphlet with instructions for reimbursement. This was in early July. It took me 4 months and a complaint to the British Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution to be reimbursed for the equivalent of $77. There was no apology, no recognition, not even a free drink coupon for that next flight I won’t ever take with British. Like a bad insurance claim, British just kept denying my claim, expecting that I would just go away. Well, I am going away. I’m taking my $77 and using another airline for future travel.",

I know this because all my bags were weighed more than the actual weight. I had an international connection from New Delhi and when my bags we’more weighed again at the Delhi International airport they weighed 1.75 kg less for each bag. If the payment for excess baggage exceeds 1000INR than the payment machine stops working and the passenger is asked to pay in cash. Then the invoice printer stops working. So at the end of the day you will be wrongly charged for excess baggage weight, you will need to pay in cash and don’t expect to get any receipts for the payment. Being elite or business class customers will not change the unprofessional and frustrated attitude of the airport check in staff.",

I showed him my tickets and the 35 kg luggage allowance was clearly mentioned, but he still did not understood. He pressurised me to pay extra for the luggage. I refused to be checked in and spoke to the staff and went back to the really long queue waiting at business class counter. During check-in at the business class counter, I was informed that the premium economy check-in person has already added an overweight luggage alert to my ticket and I will have to pay extra even though I was well within the allowed luggage allowance. More than 1 hour was already wasted in this process and I was getting late for the flight. The premium economy check in-person left his desk and approached me and asked me to pay in cash and no receipt was provided. I asked to speak to a senior or a customer complaints team member, but this premium economy person informed that if I wanted to lodge a complaint I could email the customer care. I had to pay him cash to clear the overweight alert and to process my boarding pass. Overall an absolutely absolutely disgusting experience with Air India business class.",

For no reason at all, Air India down-graded some sectors of my booking to economy seats at a very late stage and I was unable to change to another airline. To make it even worse they booked me in the worst possible middle row seats in the rear of the aircraft. Of course I complained to Air India. Their customer care team understood my complaint and regretted the situation. Frankly, I really don't care about their understanding or regret. Yes, they did refund me for the downgraded sectors, which would be mandatory in any event. However this defeated the purpose I had booked to fly with them in the first instance.

         "✅Trip Verified|   My mother was traveling alone from JFK New York to Varanasi via New Delhi, and what should have been a manageable journey turned into an unacceptable nightmare. When I initially booked her ticket, she had a 2.5-hour layover in Delhi— more than enough time to transfer flights. However, just two days before departure, Air India changed the flight schedule, reducing her transit time to just 30 minutes. Concerned, I immediately called their customer service, who assured me that 30 minutes was sufficient and that ground staff would assist her in catching her next flight. Even when my mom checked in at the JFK airport prior to here flight, she mentioned about this and they told her she will be assisted by a ground staff. That was a blatant lie. When my mother arrived in Delhi, there was nobody to assist her. She was left stranded and, despite doing her best to catch her connection, she missed it.  Air India staff told her there were no available flights for two days. They made no effort to rebook her on another airline. They refused to provide any meaningful assistance. My mother has severe anxiety issues, and I had to calm her down over the phone while booking her a flight on a different airline for the next day. The only thing Air India offered was a refund for the missed flight, which should have never been necessary in the first place. On her return journey from Delhi to JFK, she arrived at the airport 3 hours early, only to be told there was an issue with her ticket. The reason? Because she didn’t take the Delhi to Varanasi flight, her entire ticket was \"frozen\" — a term the customer service agent used. We were not informed that this would happen. The Air India app still showed the ticket as confirmed. The ground staff was rude, dismissive, and completely unhelpful. To make matters worse, they outright told her there would be no refund for the ticket they canceled due to their own delay. This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered. The lack of accountability, compassion, and professionalism from Air India’s staff is disgraceful. My family and I will never fly with Air India again.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   Literally the worst flight I have ever taken.  Booked my seat, 42C a month ago, as I need to have an aisle because I get quite claustrophobic. Confirmed 42c at online check in. At the airport was given a middle seat and told to get it changed onboard. Onboard they said there was nothing they could do. Customer services could not have been more unhelpful. Inflight entertainment was working for about half the seats near me. No problem, I'll read my book, except that my light wasn't working, so that wasn't possible when they dimmed the lights. Asked for a gin and tonic at the pre dinner drinks service, apparently no gin on this flight! Was then served a truly insipid meal.  Cabin staff poorly trained: shouted orders at passengers with regard to seat backs, seatbelts, tray tables etc. Wouldn't fly with them again if they paid me.",

Tiny seat, barely more leg room than economy seats. I understand using these small planes for short domestic flights but for a 4 and a half hour international flight completely inappropriate and a total rip off for customers paying for a business class experience, especially tall passengers. The airline has to really sort out their priorities in terms of aircraft for international flights, the worst I have experienced which is saying something considering I fly 200 days a year, will never fly this airline again!",

Unfortunately the weight of the puppy with the carrier cage was more than 2 kg over the limit and also there was another pet that was also travelling in the flight. So I had no option but to let him travel along with the cargo. But unlike what you expect from normal ground staff, the AI staff (Suchitra and her team) was really instrumental in giving all help and support to my puppy and me. They arranged a place for me to wait with him till the boarding was almost complete and then only was I parted from my pet. Also I was able to see that they personally took him to the ramp until he was safely loaded in the cargo hold. Also they did a follow-up check at night ensuring my pet was safe and sound when he reached Delhi. Kudos and heartfelt gratitude to the team for doing over and above instead of just treating him as just another piece of luggage. Wishing the team Air India Trivandrum the very best.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   I booked my flight a month ago to avoid any last-minute issues, but Air India changed my flight timings three times before my actual travel date. Then, just one hour before departure, they canceled my flight via email, leaving me stranded with no proper alternative. They rebooked me for a flight the next day, but it had a 16-hour layover for a simple domestic connection, which was completely unreasonable. With help from my travel agency, I managed to change it to a better option, but I had to pay an extra £46 just to reschedule. I stay in a different place and because of this I had to stay at a random place in London because of my next day flight. Unfortunately, due to an Elizabeth Line failure, I missed my flight the next day. I immediately went to the Air India reception desk at the airport, where the staff initially said they would help. Instead, they wasted 30 minutes of my time, only to tell me at the end that I was a \"no-show\" and that all my remaining tickets were canceled. To make matters worse, the flight  left 45 minutes late. Now, Air India doesn’t even pick up my calls, making it impossible to get any resolution. Despite explaining my situation and requesting a rebooking or at least a partial refund, they refused to assist in any way. In the end, I only received £13 back from my £926 ticket, and I had to pay £1,500 for a last-minute replacement flight. Their customer service is unprofessional, dismissive, and completely unhelpful. Instead of assisting a stranded passenger, they chose to do nothing. I will never book with Air India again and strongly advise others to choose a more reliable airline that values its passengers and provides genuine customer support.",

The boarding process was smooth and on time. The aircraft was spotless, and the service onboard was impeccable with a full meal service, hot drinks and water served. The meal service was a nice surprise given almost all domestic carriers around the world have dispensed of this.

Today, as we have always done in the past years for international departures, we stopped our taxi midway or slightly further up the taxi lanes at Delhi IGI Airport for our 5th January 2025, 2:45 AM flight AI162 from Delhi to London Heathrow. Once inside, we found the Air India counters at the very first spot, Section A, where only local or national departures are typically situated. We had to tread all the way with our heavy luggage, even though we used the services of two paid porters at INR 500 per porter. The Air India staff seemed perpetually exhausted, and no one wanted to check us in, each trying to pass us on to the next colleague. At most counters, printers were broken, or staff were missing from their seats. The ones at their counters gave such disapproving looks that you’d feel blamed just for approaching them! It took them 20 to 30 minutes just to check in one family of three members. After finally being checked in, we headed to immigration clearance near the Air India counters, only to be told that this section was for national departures. We were instructed to go back from Section A/1 to the middle of the airport, starting from Section 7 onwards. Once again, we had a long walk from one end of the departure lounge to the other, a good 10 to 15-minute walk. We joined a long queue for immigration clearance, followed by repeated self-security checks, with multiple checks at every step. The security personnel at the counters seemed unnecessarily strict. Finally, we had a long walk to Gate 10A, taking another 20 minutes or more. This was enough - I am done with Air India forever!",

This miscommunication wasted time and money on unnecessary train travel. My baggage contained medicines, perishables, and essential clothes, causing stress and financial loss.

         "✅Trip Verified| Air India, a crying shame! I booked Premium Economy from Dubai to Bangalore via Delhi, but they downgraded me to Economy without explanation! Despite showing my confirmed Premium Economy ticket, Air India staff in Dubai claimed the Delhi-Bangalore flight had no Premium Economy seats. After hours of back-and-forth, I was told I would be upgraded to Business Class. However, when I landed in Delhi, the staff had no record of this! The transfer desk in Delhi was a nightmare. Staff had no information on my case, and seniors refused to respond to juniors' calls or hung up on them. With the flight to Bangalore departing, I was offered a refund or a different flight. No resolution, no apology. Why would I need to visit the reservation counter when I had already made advance bookings? A wild goose chase was the last thing I needed in the middle of the night. Departure was less than half an hour away, and the check-in staff were frantically trying to reach out to seniors for assistance. Despite a sleepless night, I boarded the flight with the allotted ticket and seat. I met three other passengers who had flown in from San Francisco. We rushed through security and sprinted to Gate 42 with no carts provided. We ran to the gate, and I boarded with little choice. The irony: I paid for my preferred seat and schedule, but Air India failed to deliver. On the bus to the aircraft, I met a young man with a bleeding hand and knees who fell while running during the last-minute gate change. I landed in Bangalore red-eyed and exhausted at 6:30 AM, only to find that my checked-in baggage was not loaded in Delhi. I received an email from Air India in Delhi confirming receipt of the checked-in bag immediately after boarding. What happened in between? I have been in Bangalore since yesterday morning, and my luggage is still missing. At least ten other passengers’ baggage was not loaded either. The staff's lack of concern and empathy is appalling. The staff at Bangalore airport's luggage section needs more training in communication skills. Unacceptable. Air India is a disaster. I wish I had believed all the stories before booking. Never again. Lesson learned: Always research and read reviews before booking. Don’t make the same mistake I did.",

Eventually, after several false starts, we were served dinner -- as it turned out, just as the plane was getting ready to leave. The guy across the aisle from me was still forking food into his mouth when we were taking off! I just missed my connection of 3 hours and 40 minutes in Delhi, and it took several additional hours before the ground staff put the six or so of us trying to go to Addis Ababa onto flights the next day and sent us off to a hotel by the airport. The next morning, it turned out that they had completely messed up my connection to South Africa, and it took another hour to get everything straightened out. It was really a relief when I finally made it to Addis and then on to Cape Town a day late. Ethiopian Airlines is fine, but it needs to stop putting innocent people on hapless Air India.

         "Not Verified| After the takeover of Air India, I made a commitment to fly only with Air India as a show of support for Tata, an organization that has contributed so much to my country. I was aware that the airline faced challenges, but I chose them nonetheless. On a recent flight, however, I was unexpectedly downgraded from business class to economy because my selected seat, along with two others, had been non-operational for several days. Shockingly, the airline still allowed me to select this faulty seat, and there was no mention of the issue during check-in. The flight experience was extremely disappointing. The seats had clearly been out of service for some time, yet no efforts were made to address the issue. With only a one-hour turnaround time, it seemed clear that maintenance was neglected. Being downgraded with no alternative options provided—such as rerouting through Mumbai or Delhi—felt completely unacceptable. The service, both on the ground and in the air, was unprofessional and disappointing, reminiscent of the old government-run days. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied.",

We had to stay overnight at the airport hotel in T2 to make the very early flight. Check in was before 5 AM and it was smooth but security measures were strict. The flight was full and it is worthwhile to pay the USD12 for advance seat selection. We left a few minutes early and it was smooth 2 hours journey. Breakfast was included in economy. It was nothing special but appreciated by us as we had no time to eat before departure. Flight crew was efficient. Seat and aircraft were clean. We booked early and scored a low fare. But fare was not refundable. Indigo is an alternative low cost competitor with somewhat lower prices. But we are star alliance members of which air India is a partner.

         "✅Trip Verified|   I was appalled by the knowledge and customer service provided by Air India personnel in Chennai and Delhi. They lack proper training and are surprisingly unaware of their own processes. As a pet cat owner, I was relieved that Air India is one of the few airlines that allows pets in the cabin. However, my experience was far from satisfactory. I travelled from Chennai to Guwahati on AI 430 (Chennai to Delhi) and AI 891 (Delhi to Guwahati). It was a connecting flight, as Air India does not offer a direct service from Chennai to Guwahati. At the check-in counter, the attendant assisting me had no idea about the process of travelling with a pet on a connecting flight. She initially gave me a boarding pass for my luggage only to Delhi and instructed me to check in again in Delhi for the onward journey. When I asked if this was due to my pet, she insisted it was the standard procedure. After some back and forth, she called her supervisor, who clarified that I should check in my luggage for my final destination. This argument took 20 minutes and was a complete waste of time. Regarding my pet, they again refused to allow me to check her in for the entire journey, claiming it was a connecting flight. But that was the logic, that in a connecting flight, you are checked in till the final destination. After another 30 minutes of discussion, they finally agreed to check her in only to Delhi. During this process, they charged me a tax for pet travel, even though I had previously travelled with Air India without being charged. I was not provided a receipt because their printer was malfunctioning, and the entire check-in process took over an hour, leaving me with insufficient time to complete security checks and board. Once I arrived in Delhi, the attendant at the transfer counter was surprised that my pet hadn't been checked through to Guwahati. This meant I had to go through security again, removing my cat and hand luggage multiple times until I reached the check-in counter. There, I was informed that I was second in line for pets, as only two pets are allowed per flight. I was fine with this, but after 30 minutes, I was called back to the counter and informed that I could not travel because I was third in line. The staff member told me and then left as her shift ended, forcing me to start the explaining and arguing process all over again with new staff. After another 45 minutes of discussion, I explained that I had a connecting flight. If they denied me boarding, Air India would need to provide hotel accommodation and a new ticket. Fortunately, a senior staff member intervened, recognized the issue, and permitted me to board while denying passage to the other passenger from Delhi. This senior staff member explained that the confusion stemmed from the need for pet approval at the initial boarding location, something the Chennai staff seemed completely unaware of. I had to pay for my pet's travel a second time, but thankfully, they did not charge tax this time, contradicting what the Chennai staff had said. The entire experience was filled with arguments and wasted time and money, transforming what should have been an enjoyable trip into a headache.",

         "Not Verified| I recently flew with Air India on September 24, 2024, from Leh to Amritsar with a layover in Delhi, and it was one of the most frustrating experiences I’ve had with an airline. Our flight from Leh was delayed by an hour, and upon arrival in Delhi, we were informed without any prior notice that our connecting flight to Amritsar had been rescheduled to 9:00 PM. This change was made without our consent, and when I called customer service, I was told there were no other flights available. The staff at the Delhi airport were unhelpful and unresponsive. I was shocked that ground staff in Leh could not reach their colleagues in Delhi for assistance. The manager at the Delhi airport showed little interest in addressing our concerns, and the general attitude from staff was dismissive. To make matters worse, we observed that the 2:00 PM flight to Amritsar was still at the gate when we arrived. If we had been directed to that flight, we could have made it without issue. The food provided during our wait was inadequate, and we were not offered lounge access or even water. My frequent flyer points could not be added to my booking despite purchasing expensive tickets, and I was left feeling misled and frustrated. I wasted 12 hours with Air India, and I will think twice before flying with them again. Overall, I was very disappointed with the lack of support and communication from the staff. I hope my experience serves as a caution to others.",

         "✅Trip Verified|   I’ve flown Air India from Washington DC to New Delhi more than 10 times over the past few years, and overall my experience has been positive, with a few expected caveats. The non-stop flight, which takes around 14 hours, is a game-changer. Other airlines like Emirates or Etihad may save about 45 minutes in flight time, but the layovers add at least five extra hours to the journey. In my opinion, the extra time isn’t worth it. In economy, the seats are comfortable with decent legroom, so no complaints there. The check-in process has been smooth both in DC and New Delhi, and the cabin crew is generally polite and professional, which makes a difference on such long flights. I’ve chosen to stick with Air India even when it’s more expensive than other carriers because the convenience of flying direct outweighs the higher cost. That said, there are a few areas where improvement is needed. The aircraft on this route is showing its age, and the in-flight electronics are often broken. However, this isn’t a major issue for me since I bring my iPad and AirPods for entertainment. The food is decent, though a bit spicy at times. One thing that stands out is the strange timing of meal service on the return flight from Delhi to DC. Breakfast is served around 9 PM DC time, and dinner with drinks follows at about 2 or 3 AM, even though the flight lands at 7 AM. This timing makes it hard to get meals or sleep in sync with the destination. Despite these quirks, I’m happy with Air India overall. The convenience and comfort of flying direct make up for the minor issues, and I plan to continue using them until the new aircraft arrive and hopefully, things will only get better from there.",
